It is to write out the undergoing changes and idea of the code that we want to moddify

In main, we have pm init, call one nc_factor, we want to change it to non-linear so that the code is good in all time step.

Scheme 1: We will init a nc_factor, make the plan, then after certain time/redshift, we destroy it and initialize again.

In concept, under construction.

Scheme 2: just make a few plans, directly call them. This will have a worse memory allocation

In concept, construct after scheme 1.
